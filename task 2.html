Difference between Browser JS(console) vs Nodejs


*  Nodejs
Node doesn’t have a predefined “window” object cause it doesn’t have a window to draw anything.

“location” object is related to a particular url; that means it is for page specific. So, node doesn’t require that.

Ofcourse Node doesn’t have “document” object also, cause it never have to render anything in a page.

Node has “global”, which is a predefined global object. It contains several functions that are not available in browsers, cause they are needed for server side works only.

“require” object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app.


* JS(console)

“window” is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window that has been drawn.

“location” is another predefined object in browsers, that has all the information about the url we have loaded.

“document”, which is also another predefined global variable in browsers, has the html which is rendered.

Browsers may have an object named “global”, but it will be the exact one as “window”.

Browsers don’t have “require” predefined. You may include it in your app for asynchronous file loading.

Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript, i.e. in browsers.


2  SUMMARY 
  render website

1. parsing html 
    * parse tree 
 2   dom tree
    * render tree
3  yes the video shows how does the browser actully render a website
    we learn about parsing layout painting  etc 

4  yes is briefly expalin one by one to understanding 
   actully the broweser  render works
5    layout computes where a node will be on the scree
painting computes bitmaps and composities to screen

6 
 I ’ll understand  place script tags at the bottom of the document, inlining 
critical CSS & all sorts of other performance techniques.



3 EXCUTE THE CODE 
Execute the below code and write your description in txt file
1. typeof(1)
  * type of 1 is number 

2. typeof(1.1)
 * type of 1.1 is number 

3. typeof('1.1')
  *  type of  ('1.1') string

4. typeof(true)
 * type of true is boolean

5 .typeof(null)
* type of null is object
